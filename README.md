**Breast Cancer Prediction Project**

This GitHub repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on predicting breast cancer diagnosis. The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - The dataset is loaded from a CSV file containing information about breast cancer cases.
   - Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed, including checking the shape, data types, and summary statistics.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values: Columns with missing values are dropped from the dataset.
   - Converting categorical to numerical: The 'diagnosis' column is transformed into numerical values using label encoding.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visualizations, such as count plots and pair plots, provide insights into the distribution of diagnoses and relationships between variables.
   - Correlation analysis using a heatmap illustrates the correlation between different features.

4. **Feature Scaling:**
   - The dataset is split into independent (X) and dependent (Y) variables.
   - Standard scaling is applied to normalize the feature values.

5. **Model Training:**
   - Three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—are trained on the preprocessed data.
   - Model accuracies on the training dataset are printed.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy scores are computed to evaluate the models on the test set.
   - Predictions are made using the trained models.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The project aims to develop a predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis based on input features.
   - Users can explore the code, visualizations, and model performance to gain insights into the predictive capabilities of the implemented machine learning models.
